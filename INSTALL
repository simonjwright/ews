Prerequisites
=============

EWS requires GNAT (GNAT GPL 2012 or later, FSF GCC 4.8.0 or later) and
XML/Ada. GNAT GPL 2013 (and, hopefully, later) includes XML/Ada;
earlier versions supply XML/Ada as source which has to be built and
installed.

EWS's build process uses GNU Make, run from the command line. This
will be available as "make" on Linux or Mac OS X systems, and on
Windows systems running Cygwin[1].

Pure Windows systems
====================

A suitable GNU Make for Windows is available at AdaCore[2] (in the
avr-elf-windows 2012 package). It's also been copied to
Sourceforge[3].

The download (whose MD5 hash is f97b4a805d7ec4c63ad829c822c4c42b) is
gnumake-3.79.1-pentium-mingw32msv.exe. Rename it to gmake.exe and
place it in GNAT's bin directory (typically C:\GNAT\2013\bin).

Then, in a command window in the EWS distribution's top-level
directory (ews-yyyymmdd\),

   > gmake

will build the library, and, in the doc\ directory
(ews-yyyymmdd\doc\),

   > gmake demo

will create a server (ews_demo), which when executed will listen on
port 8080 and respond with the web in the doc\ directory.

Unix-based systems
==================

In the EWS distribution's top-level directory (ews-yyyymmdd/), "make"
will build the library, and "make demo" will create a server in the
doc/ directory (ews-yyyymmdd/doc/ews_demo), which when executed will
listen on port 8080 and respond with the web in the doc/ directory.

The package can be installed with the compiler by "make install" (more
likely, "sudo make install"). You can install in an alternative place
by setting "prefix", for example

   $ make install prefix=~/local

Using the package
=================

ews.pdf, in the doc/ directory of the distribution, contains
descriptions of the EWS features used in the demonstration, and
related source code.
