 * and initiate it by calling send() (if there is a query,
 * send(query); when the response arrives, calls 'handler'(request) --
 * you can get its responseText or responseXML as appropriate. If
 * 'interval' is non-null, repeats every 'interval' milliseconds.
 *
 * @param url      The URL to which the request is to be sent.
 * @param query    The query which is to be sent, if any.
 * @param handler  The handler to be called when the response arrives,
 *                 with parameter the completed request.
 * @param interval If non-null, the interval in milliseconds between
 *                 repeat requests.
 * @class          This is an abstract base class for HTTP interactions.
