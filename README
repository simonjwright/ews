This release of EWS allows the software to be built as a library.

It requires an Ada2012-capable compiler (GCC 4.8 or later, GNAT GPL
2012 or later).

It no longer requires the Booch Components (XML/Ada is still
required).

This release of EWS sends the whole of a Response via a single system
call (provided the total is less than half a megabyte!)

It expects the Booch Components and XML/Ada to be installed (in other
words, "bc.gpr" and "xmlada.gpr" are accessible either in the default
location or via ADA_PROJECT_PATH).
